# World-wild-covid-data-set
To analyse and predict the covid cases all over the world of 2021 dataset

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze and predict COVID-19 cases worldwide using the dataset from the year 2021. The dataset includes various attributes such as Total Cases, Total Deaths, Total Recovered, Active Cases, Total Cases per Million, Deaths per Million, Total Tests, Tests per Million, and Population for different countries.

## Analysis Questions
1. **Skewness Analysis:**
   - Determine the skewness for Total Cases, Total Deaths, Total Recovered, and Active Cases.

2. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - What is the correlation between Total Recovered and Active Cases?
   - Is there a positive relationship between population tested and recovered?
   - What is the correlation between Total Deaths and Total Cases?

3. **Country-wise Analysis:**
   - Which countries have the highest and lowest number of active cases (top 7)?
   - Which countries have the highest and lowest number of death cases (top 7)?

4. **Population Testing and Recovery:**
   - Total tests with respect to the population.

5. **Recovered Cases Analysis:**
   - Total recovered COVID cases with respect to countries.

6. **Death Rate Analysis:**
   - Number of deaths within a population.

## Dataset Columns Explanation
1. **Country:** The country of origin.
2. **Total Cases:** The total COVID cases in that country.
3. **Total Deaths:** The total deaths due to COVID in that country.
4. **Total Recovered:** The total patients recovered from COVID in that country.
5. **Active Cases:** The total active COVID cases in that country.
6. **Total Cases/1M population:** Total cases per million of population.
7. **Deaths/1M population:** Total deaths per million of population.
8. **Total Tests:** Total COVID testing done in that country.
9. **Tests/1M population:** Total COVID testing done per million of population.
10. **Population:** The total population of that country.

## Conclusion
Through machine learning models and data visualization analysis, we can infer that the total cases increase with an increase in population. Various factors like population, total tests, active cases, etc., influence the total cases. The project aims to provide insights and predictions regarding COVID-19 cases worldwide based on the given dataset.
